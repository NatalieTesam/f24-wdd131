              great here as it is in the open and so insects will happily fly

            General Listing Information
          </h2>
          <p>
            Listings are available based on three criteria.
            <strong
              >Landlord Hospitality, Restaurant quality, and
              Expandability.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Landlord Hospitality</strong> is pretty straight forward. If
            the person who lives in the area with you is nice and will not
            bother you, or if they may decide to one day kill you on accident if
            you step too far from home.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Restaurant quality</strong> includes the variety and
            frequency of bugs that may wander into your clutches. Based on the
            location, there could be good air traffic or bad air traffic
            increasing the variety of flying insects to munch on versus if there
            are alot of crawling insects that may wander into your home.
          </p>
          <p>
            And the last criteria, expandability.
            <strong>Expandability</strong> is just the available room to expand
            before it goes too far and the landlord might evict you, especially
            if you are a hoarder and get too greedy, or your home may expand too
            far and be liable to damages from nearby regular movement.
