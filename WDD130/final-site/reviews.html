            My budget was small and they tried to find the best they could with
            what I had. The listings are all so pretty and great priced. If I
            ever live long enough to get another home I will be using Arachnae

            home about 3 feet away from it they saw me and a loud resonating
            screach left their mouth. I almost died from the shock, and the shoe
            they threw at me following those events. They helped me regain
            relations with the realtor and we agreed that I can only go 3 inches
