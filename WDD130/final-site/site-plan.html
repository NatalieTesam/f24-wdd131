      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Are you an eight-legged arachnid in search of a safe warm home suitable for your millions 
        of children? Well, look no farther than Arachne Real Estate, the only suitable website for 
        Spiders searching for that dream home. In it are a range of listings based on three different 
        factors. Landlord hospitality, nearby restaurant quality, and Expandability. Also, we have a 
        hit critic, Natasha Romanoff, the black widow herself, rate all the spaces available. We only 
        cater to varieties non-lethal to humans. The real purpose is to entertain people with the site
        while also being informational about different types of spiders.</p>


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Spiders in search of a home for a reasonable price and location. But in reality, people who 
        are curious about what spider real estate is and who want to be entertained by the notion of
        spiders having a real estate agency. People of all ages who want a good laugh or who want to
        know a bit about different types of spiders. </p>

        Typography
      </h3>

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Shadows Into Light Two
      </h4>
      <p>
        I wanted a font that looked handwritten, but not cursive, but also clean at the same time 
        while looking slim like a spider's web. I might include a serif paragraph font later on as 
        the website develops for the different sections of information.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Roboto
      </h4>
      <p>
        I like fonts that are easy to read and so I chose one that didn't seem to conflict with 
        the heading fonts as well.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs.  Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and experienced rafters.  No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it happen for you.

      <h3>Listings</h3>
      <p>
        Listings are available based on three criteria. Landlord Hospitality, Restaurant quality, and Expandability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Landlord Hospitality is pretty straight forward. If the person who lives in the area with you is nice and will
        not bother you, or if they may decide to one day kill you on accident if you step too far from home.</p>
      <p>
        Restaurant quality includes the variety and frequency of bugs that may wander into your clutches. Based on the location, there
        could be good air traffic or bad air traffic increasing the variety of flying insects to munch on versus if there 
        are alot of crawling insects that may wander into your home. 
      </p>
      <p>
        And the last criteria, expandability. Expandability is just the available room to expand 
        before it goes too far and the landlord might evict you, especially if you are a 
        hoarder and get too greedy, or your home may expand too far and be liable to damages from nearby regular movement. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        
      <li>North-East Bedroom Corner</li>
        <p>
          Someones head is around here when they sleep so it would be low landlord hospitality, low expandability, but high
          restaurant quality because it is very open and airy there.
        </p>
      <li>North-West Bedroom Corner</li>
        <p>
          Someones head is around here when they sleep so it would be low landlord hospitality, low expandability, but high
          restaurant quality because it is very open and airy there.          
        </p>
      <li>South-East Bedroom Corner</li>
        <p>
          Not much happens movement wise, landlord would probably not mind if you lived there but medium expandability. There is also
          high restaurant quality because it has the same air circulation as the northern corners, medium landlord hospitality.
        </p>
      <li>South-West Bedroom Corner</li>
        <p>
          The door opens and closes very frequently, so a slight risk if expanded too far. Its a corner not looked at too much, so landlord
          hispitality there is high, and restaurant quality there is the best because all of the incoming bugs will likely pass through there.
        </p>
      <li>Bathroom Above Toilet</li>
      <li>Kitchen Corner Above Fridge</li>
      <li>In the Window Behind the Blinds</li>
        <p>
          Gets pretty bright during the day, but not much movement in the top section. The blinds are opened halfway at the most every day,
          so low expandability, high landlord hospitality, due to being out of sight, out of mind. 
        </p>
      <li>In the Closet Behind the Jackets [SOLD]</li>
        <p>
          Not much movement and a very secluded location. No expandability past 4 inches or risk to the home. The landlord will never even mess with
          you because they probably will not find you. There are virtually no insects coming there, so you will starve though.
        </p>

      <h3>Reviews</h3>
      <p>
        There are reviews from past patrons as well as our home critics who rate every site, Daddy Longlegs and the Black Widow.
        (Note she is not a real black widow.) 
      </p>
      <p>
        "I love this site, I lived in the closet behind the coats and it was not the best, and so the realtors helped me to see 
      all of the different places I could live safetly, very helpful and would recommend this to any spiders who are scared to 
      find their homes in this apartment." -Spider who lived behind my coat.
